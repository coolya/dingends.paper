\ac{GDB}

The \ac{LLVM} project~\cite{LLDB} comes with a C debugger named \ac{LLDB}.
Tests for this debugger are written in Python and with the 
unittest framework that comes with Python.
While those test verify the debugger's command
line interface and the scripting API, they also test other functionality, such
as using the help menu or changing the debugger settings.
Further, some of those tests
verify the debugging behavior on different platforms, such as Darwin, Linux or
FreeBSD.
In contrast to the \ac{LLDB} project, we only concentrate on testing
the debugging behavior. The approach for doing so is derived from the \ac{LLDB} 
project:
write a program in the source-language (mbeddr), compile it to an executable and
debug it through test cases, which verify the debugging behavior. While the 
\ac{LLDB} project also tests other aspects with Python scripts, we could invent
further \acp{DSL} for testing those aspects as well.
