\section{Related Work}

Wu et al. describe a unit testing framework for 
\acp{DSL}~\cite{DBLP:conf/dsl/WuGM09} with focus on
testing the semantics of the language.  However, it is necessary that testing
\acp{DSL} cover all related aspects of the language \eg editor
(concrete syntax), type system, scoping, transformation rules, and finally the
debugger.\footnote{Specific language workbenches might require
testing of additional aspects}
mbeddr contains tests for the editor, type system, scoping and transformation
rules, our work contributes the language for testing the debugger aspect.

\ac{LLVM} project~\cite{LLDB} comes with a C debugger named \ac{LLDB}.
Test cases for this debugger are written in Python
and the unittest framework of Python. While those tests verify the debugger’s
command line interface and the scripting API, they also test other
functionality, such as using the help menu or changing the debugger settings.
Further, some of the \ac{LLDB} tests verify the debugging behavior on different
platforms, such as Darwin, Linux or FreeBSD. In contrast, we only concentrate on
testing the debugging behavior and we also support writing tests against
specific platforms. However, the approach for testing the debugging behavior is
derived from the \ac{LLDB} project: write a program in the source-language (mbeddr),
compile it to an executable and debug it through test cases, which verify the
debugging behavior.

The \ac{GDB} provided by the GNU project takes a similar approach as
the \ac{LLDB}: debugger tests cover different aspects of the debugger’s
functionality and are written in a scripting language~\cite{gdb}.
Contrarily, to our approach of testing the debugging behavior 
for one extensible language, \ac{GDB} project tests
debugging behavior for all of its supported languages, such as C, C++, Java, Ada
etc. Further, those tests run on different platforms and different target
configurations. Our work supports writing tests against different platforms, but
does not allow users to change the target configuration via the \ac{DSL}.
