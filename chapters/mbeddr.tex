\subsection{Languages}
mbeddr is a open source project focused on supporting embedded software development. It uses a set of modular domain-specific extensions to C and also supports other languages for addressing common problems in software development, for example, writing documentation with close integration to code or capturing requirements. mbeddr is build using JetBrains MPS language workbench. MPS supports the definition, composition and use of general purpose or domain specific languages. To archive this MPS uses a projectional editor, this means, even if the notation might look textual it is not represented as a sequence of characters, which are transformed into a AST by parsing. In contrast
