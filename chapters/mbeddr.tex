\section{mbeddr}


The mbeddr open source project focused on supporting embedded software development. It introduces a set of of modular domain-specific extensions to C and also supports other languages for addressing common problems in software development, for example, writing documentation with close integration to code or capturing requirements. mbeddr is build using JetBrains MPS language workbench. MPS supports the definition, composition and use of general purpose or domain specific languages. To archive this MPS uses a projectional editor, this means, even if the notation might look textual it is not represented as a sequence of characters, which are transformed into a AST by parsing. In contrast user actions manipulate the AST directly. The AST is then rendered to the user according to editor specifications/projection rules. These rules are not limited to textual notations, for example can tabular or mathematical notations can be used if appropriated. Since no parsing ambiguities can occur a wide range of languages extension can be used.
