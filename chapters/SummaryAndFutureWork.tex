\section{Summary and Future Work}

In this paper we have \ldots

In the future, we will investigate ways for integrating the debugger specication
\ac{DSL} with the \ac{DSL} for debugger testing. From this integration we
expect to (1) gain advances in validating debugger test cases and
(2) the possibility to derive test cases from the debugger specification. 
In addition, we will continue researching on languages for testing
non-functional aspects, such as testing the performance of stepping commands and
lifting of program state.
While we will continue our work on testing debuggers, we will also
research on methodologies for building debuggers for extensible
languages, \ie on ways to derive debuggers from code generators and
transformation rules.
