\section{Summary and Future Work}

mbeddr comes with a debugger for extensible languages.
To test this debugger, we have introduced in this paper a generic and extensible
testing \ac{DSL}.
The language is implemented in \ac{MPS} with a focus on mbeddr, but the
underlying approach is applicable for testing any imperative language debugger. Further, we
have shown in this paper (1) the implementation of a language extension, (2) how
debugging support is build for it and (3) how the debugger is tested with use of
our \ac{DSL}. The language is designed for extensibility, so others can contribute
their own context-specific validation rules. In addition, we concentrated on
reuse, so test data, test structures and validation rules can be shared among
tests.

In the future, we plan to investigate ways for integrating the debugger
specification \ac{DSL} with the \ac{DSL} for testing the debugger extension. From this
integration we expect to (1) gain advances in validating debugger test cases and
(2) the possibility to automatically generate test cases from formal debugger
specifications (based on work
from~\cite{conf/kbse/WuG05,henriques05,journals/spe/WuGM08}).
In addition, we will continue
researching on languages for testing non-functional aspects, such as testing the
performance of stepping commands and lifting of program state.
