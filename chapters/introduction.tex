\section{Introduction}
Software development faces the challenge that general purpose languages do not provide the appropriate abstracts for many domains in which they are used. Traditionally there are two major approaches to overcome this issue. One is to use frameworks that provide the domains specific abstractions for the developer. This approach has very limited support for static semantics. Most \acp{GPL} do not support modification of constrains or typesystem. The second is to use external \acp{DSL} to give the developer a language to express solutions to domain problems. This approach has some other drawbacks. \TODO{monolithic, all in advanced, central, foo bar}.
 

Provide some context and talk about the following things:
- extensible languages
- debuggers 
- testing of debugger implementations
